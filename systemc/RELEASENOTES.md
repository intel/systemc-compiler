Warning: _The fixed-point data-types are not working as defined on
MSVC 2017 and later in Release x64 mode._

This release has not been tested or is known not to work as expected
on the following formerly supported platforms:

* GNU C++ compiler versions prior to 9.3.0 (all platforms)
* FreeBSD 9.0 or later (x86, x86_64) with GNU C++ compiler
* HP-UX 11.00 or later with GNU C++ or HP C++ compiler
* Sun/Oracle Solaris, with GNU C++ or Sun/Solaris Studio compiler
* macOS prior to 11.6 (Big Sur) and/or on the x86, PowerPC architectures
* Microsoft Visual C++ versions prior to 2017 (15.0)
* Cygwin 1.7 or later (x86, x86_64) with GNU C++ compiler
* Msys/MinGW32 GNU C++ compiler

2. (In)compatibility note

While it is possible to build SystemC as a shared library (both on
ELF-based systems and well as a DLL on Windows), there is no explicitly
defined binary interface across different
  - SystemC implementations (e.g. from multiple vendors)
  - SystemC library versions
  - Compilers or compiler versions
  - Operating systems or OS versions

   Some differences might be caught at link time, while other incompatibilities 
   could just silently lead to undefined behavior during simulation. Please carefully 
   ensure a consistent build configuration, when integrating binary SystemC models built 
   from separate sources.


## 2. What's new in this release?

This version of SystemC contains bug fixes and minor improvements of Reference Implementation
simulator.

Please consult the IEEE Std. 1666-2023 SystemC Language Reference Manual for details about the current SystemC standard.

Compared to the 3.0.0 release, this release has the following new items:

  - Bug fixes and enhancements, see section 4.

  - Deprecated features, see section 5.

  - Experimental features (some disabled by default), see section 7.
    Testing and feedback welcome via the Accellera SystemC forums
    at http://forums.accellera.org/forum/9-systemc/.
    

## 3. New features

Being a bug fix release, SystemC 3.0.1 does not provide new features.

## 4. Bug fixes and enhancements

Following is the list of bug fixes and enhancements for the 3.0.1 release:

  - Implemented remaining changes to match sc_bind up to the IEEE1666-2023 revised definition

  - Updated implementation of reset event notification in sc_process_b::trigger_reset_event to align to IEEE1666-2023
  
  - Refactored integer tracing & file writing in sc_{vcd,wif}_trace

  - Fixed issue in QuickThreads assembly on Arm 64-bit architectures

  - Cleaned up various compiler warnings

  - Improved sanitizers setup and addressed sanitizers findings

  - Addressed sanitizers findings in tests

  - Fixed SC_METHOD,SC_(C)THREAD false-positive warning on GCC/ARM64

  - Cleaned up member initialization for simple_target_socket{,_tagged}

  - Fixed failing signal_rv tests

  - Update Linux/AArch64 support & cleaned up redundant golden log files in tests

  - Fixed result type mismatches in sc_big_ops.h
  
  - Fixed several value initialization issues with sc_bv and sc_lv variables

  - Fixed assignment issue to sc_uint and sc_int

  - Fixed issues in autotools build targets install, uninstall, dist and distcheck

  - Removed no longer supported configurations from build flows

## 5. Deprecated features

No new deprecated features in this release.

## 6. C++17 support

IEEE Std. 1666-2023 mandates C++17 as the baseline for SystemC implementations.
`std::string_view` is used in new APIs.  However, `const char *` are still used
in several locations and will be progressively cleaned-up in the upcoming
releases.


## 7. Experimental features

Some of these features are not enabled in the default library
configuration and need to be explicitly activated during at
library build time.  See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.


## 8. Known Problems

  - This implementation currently truncates "small" `sc_time` objects to
    `SC_ZERO_TIME`, while "too big‚Äù objects wrap-around `sc_max_time()` and 
    lead to a value modulo the maximum time.  In both cases, no warning is 
    generated, even though such a warning is mandated by IEEE Std. 1666-2023.

  - Some typos have not been fixed yet in the version of the IEEE Std. 1666-2023 
    document available online, but have been implemented from SystemC 3.0.0 onwards:

    - the following stage callbacks are implemented
      ``` 
      void sc_register_stage_callback( sc_stage_callback_if&, int );
      void sc_unregister_stage_callback( sc_stage_callback_if&, int );
      ```
    - `static const sc_event & none()` is implemented
    - `IEEE_1666_SYSTEMC` is set to `202301L`

  - The sign-extension of mixed-signedness logic expressions (&,|)
    involving one `sc_bigint<>` operand and C++ builtin integral types
    (int, short, etc.) is inconsistent between 32-bit and 64-bit
    platforms in some cases.  Convert both operands to `sc_bigint<>` first.

  - The definition of `sc_dt::(u)int64` differs from `std::(u)int64_t` types
    on some platforms.  This may lead to problems with function overloads
    and/or format-string placeholders.  As a workaround, convert these
    values explicitly to the correct type before passing them to functions
    expecting one of these types.  For `sc_time`, use the new nested type
    `sc_time::value_type` to hold values of the underlying representation.

  - The current implementation of bit-wise operations on `sc_bv` and other
    bit types implicitly uses the left-hand argument as the size of the result
    rather than the size of the larger operand, as required by the 
    IEEE Std. 1666 standard.

  - Some paths in this release are longer than the historical 99 character
    limit of tar archives, and several Windows archivers (e.g. WinZip)
    have been reported to trip over this.  The open source archiver 7-zip
    (http://7-zip.org) is known to work.


## 9. Fixed-point library

SystemC contains a fixed-point data-types package.

Compile-time macro `SC_INCLUDE_FX` must be defined in order to build
applications that use fixed point types. You can specify a compiler
flag, e.g., `g++ -DSC_INCLUDE_FX` or use a define statement before
you include `systemc.h`, e.g.:

```
  #define SC_INCLUDE_FX
  #include "systemc.h"
```
