# Intel&reg; Compiler for SystemC* 

*\*Other names and brands may be claimed as the property of others.*

## Introduction

Intel&reg; Compiler for SystemC* (ICSC) translates synthesizable SystemC design into equivalent SystemVerilog code.

ICSC checks a SystemC design for common coding mistakes and generates human-readable SystemVerilog code. The tool supports SystemC synthesizable subset in method and thread processes, and arbitrary C++ code in module constructors. ICSC is based on Clang/LLVM 18.1.8 and includes SystemC 3.0.0.

See more information at [Intel Compiler for SystemC wiki](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/wiki).

## Single Source Library

Single Source library consists of communication channels including Target/Initiator, FIFO, Pipe, Buffer, Register and others. The channels have functional interfaces similar to TLM 1.0.

There are [Single Source training slides](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/blob/main/doc/papers/single_source_training.pdf).

See more information at [Single Source library](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/wiki/Single-Source-library).

## Getting started

ICSC is based on Clang/LLVM frontend and can be installed at most Linux OS. There is ```install.sh``` script that downloads and builds ICSC and the required dependencies at **SLES15**, **SLES12**, **Ubuntu 22.04**, and **Ubuntu 20.04**.

An instruction how to install and run ISCS is given at [Getting started](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/wiki/Getting-started). 

## Documentation 

[User guide](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/blob/main/doc/ug.pdf) document describes installation procedure, run tool options, preparation of SystemC design for synthesis, tool extensions and advanced verification features.

ICSC supports [SystemC Synthesizable Subset](https://www.accellera.org/images/downloads/drafts-review/SystemC_Synthesis_Subset_Draft_1_4.pdf). Details of SystemC/C++ subset supported are described at [SystemC/C++ supported](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/wiki/SystemC--supported).
